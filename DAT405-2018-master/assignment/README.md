# gad405
this is my code, i used references from the p5.js to hep create my main shape for my assignment. Once i had a simple platform to start, i then used my own knowledge of code to change the colours, sizing and functions.

When mouse is clicked down a flower object appears, these then follow the mouse. and vary in size depends on how fast you move the mouse. So when the mouse is moved slower, the ellipses become more close together, yet when moved faster they then become more spread out.

there is a use of commands, so when keys '1-4' are pressed the colours of the circles change, key 1 is in the RED 255, whereas 2-3 are more GREEN/BLUE, and 4 produces a random selection of colours.
